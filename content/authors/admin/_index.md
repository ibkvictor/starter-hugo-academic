I am a Research Intern at [Covenant University](https://www.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/), who is very passionate about the future of mobility through autonomous systems for navigation and intra-galactic explorations. I am an enthusiast of *deep tech* applications in Africa and the World. My current research focuses on “Modeling learning systems for forecasting Extreme wind speed”, “Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Emergency Response” , “Model Predictive Control(MPC) for Autonomous Racing” and “Learning Dynamic Control for Underactuated Robotic Systems”.

As an undergraduate student, I lead a formula-student (FS UK) team, Hebron Motorsports, to its first competition completing design for the Brake Speed Plausible Device. I also developed MPC based controller for our future autonomous racing vehicles. Furthermore, I developed a sustainable composite material using chitosan extracts from \*\* scales and performed the mechanical and morphological characterization of the developed composite.

Currently, I work as an NYSC research intern at the Energy and Environment Group, Covenant University under the supervision of [Prof. Olayinka Ohunakin](https://africa.berkeley.edu/people/olayinka-s-ohunakin) on “Modeling learning systems for forecasting Extreme wind speed”. As an NYSC corp member, I engage in promoting a drug-free society in the Ota Community by outreach program at bus stops, primary and secondary school. I am presently serving as the project coordinator on a renovation of community rehabilitation facility.

Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
